-------------------	Auction Mechanism Implementation Details And Notes ------------------

Notes:
	
	->	Each radio station selects N different channels from a pool of channels (Typically 32, in the UK for instance), this is to avoid 
		interference of channels from radio stations that are close in  terms of signal propagation distance (Power limitation).
	
	->	These stations will then sell those channels that are vacant at each station by means of the auctioning system.
	
	->	Each channel when sold, must adhere to the limitations that come with it, such as the very important power limitation.
	
	->	The server is responsible for conducting the database management and decisions regarding sales.
	
	->	The client side is responsible for querying the server for information regarding the available channels. 
		The client side then places a bid when an auction is open. Thus the server need not update the client when channels are available.
		It is the responsibility of the client to check what's available when they need it. Thus each client would could essentially have
		their own CI module running making decisions which best match the needs of the client based on parameters which are important to them, 
		such as Network load or Overall speed etc... (This CI for the client side will not be dealt with by us and is out of scope for this 
		project)
		
	->	The primary user Owns the license to the specific channel and the user is simulated using our simulator
	
	->	When a PU goes off-line it must inform the database using that it is vacating a channel which may be sold.
	
	->	The auctioneers (brokers) goal is to maximize profit while utilizing the available spectrum.
	
	->	It is very important that the auction doesn't last too long as the longer an auction lasts the more time spectrum that is wasted.
	
	->	Channels are sold off once the PU goes off-line. The leases are sold for a specific frequency band, for a specific time with a
		power limitation on the line.
	
	->	Leases for the available channel must be sold. No matter the price.
	
	-> 	It is also very important that the presence of the SU does not affect the operation of the PU.
	
Implementations:

	How leases are divided:																					Side effects.
	
		->  Idea 1:		Leases are sold on a time basis in terms of amount of time.			|	Lease states then need to be saved.
						So a specific amount of time is promised and it may be reclaimed	|	This also increases complexity in 
						whenever the PU goes off-line.										|	terms of triggering the auction because a SU
																							|	might be entitled to the line and this check 
																							|	must be kept in mind.

		->	Idea 2:		The channels are divided into discrete chunks and sold on a use		|	This is a better approach. as we don't need to  
						as its free basis, so if the channels are split into 5s chunks		|	save lease states, when the SU goes off-line.
						a user can buy say 20s, if the SU goes off-line during this time 	|	But the lease states might need to be saved,
						they lose out.														|	if the PU pushes them off-line.
		
	Selling of leases:																	
	
		->	Idea 1:		Leases are sold when the PU goes off-line.							|	If the auction lasts too long the spectrum is 
																							|	not utilized well.
			
		->  Idea 2:		Leases are pre-sold. And leases claimed when the PU goes off-line	|	Increased complexity with dealing with leases 
																							|	which are to be claimed in the future.
	
	Dealing with a PU that comes back online while a lease is being claimed:
	
		->  Idea 1:		The SU is disconnected from the line, their lease contract 			|	Increased complexity with saving lease states.

		->  Idea 2:		The SU is disconnected and loses out on the lease. (the lease gets 	|	This solves the leave state problem.

		->	Idea 3:		The SU buys a time slot in discrete chunks, for example				|	This is kind of the middle ground between the last

						used by the SU. The SU's lease state is then saved and reclaimed 	|
						later. 																|
	
	
	In my opinion i think the channels should be divided into discrete chunks. Idea 2, this allow is better than Idea 1. 
	In terms of selling the lease, this could go either way.
	Lastely in dealing with the PU as they come online. Idea 3, sounds good, but in our notes we say that the PU mostn't be affected
	by ths SU. So maybe Idea 1, if we go with the discrete chunks idea.
